Examples for GNE, in order of implementation, oldest first

exthreads -- shows the basics of creating, starting, and syncronizing with
  threads.

exuptime -- Very small example using Timer::getCurrentTime, which uses the
  rdtsc instruction where possible.  On many systems, this is time in CPU
  cycles since system start, so this is one way of getting system uptime.

extimer -- Shows usage of the Timer class.

exinput -- Shows usage of the Console class, also uses timers.

exhello -- Everyone knows the "Hello World" program.  Perhaps it's been coded
  too many times.  However, the GNE coders just plain don't care ;).
  This is an example to show the minimum code needed to connect and send
  data, in this case, "Hello Server (or Client)!" to the other end of the
  connection.  This version uses asynchronous sockets.  This example program
  should be compatable client and server with exsynchello.

expacket -- Shows how to derive a new type of packet, and create the proper
  parsing functions interacting with Buffer to allow GNE to use your packet.
  This example does NOT show how to use the packet over the network.
  See exhello for that.

exrawtest -- Basically a test of the Buffer class.  Does show usage of the
  Buffer class, but the usage in this case because this is a test uses the
  class is "hackish" ways.
  
exaddr -- A small test for the Address class that also shows its usage.

exsynchello -- Same as exhello, but uses only SyncConnections.  exsynchello
  and exhello should be able to talk to each other, but in practice it is
  not recommended to mix event-driven and SyncConnections, because it makes
  for more complex code, but it is entirely possible.

exnetperf -- Shows how to use the statistical functions in GNE.  This
  example should serve well for GNE to measure network performance, as best
  as is possible with the GNE and HawkNL APIs.

exping -- Shows how to use the PingPacket API and how to create and respond
  to PingPackets.  Also functions as a test of the PingPacket class.

expong -- It's console pong.  Over the internet.  What kind of nonsense is
  this?  Anyways, this is a COMPLETE game example showing how to do a simple
  framework for a fully functional and correct GNE game that will expand to
  fit most projects.  This means all error handling and the whole shebang.
  
exconsole -- shows off the new ConsoleBuffer/TextConsole classes, and acts
  also as a partial test of these classes.
  
exbroker --  Test of ObjectBrokerServer and ObjectBrokerClient classes.  Not
  much of an example because this usage is far from the practical usage, but
  it does show and track the state of the ObjectBrokers while they interact.

expointers -- A test for the new SmartPtr and WeakPtr reference counted
  smart pointer classes.
