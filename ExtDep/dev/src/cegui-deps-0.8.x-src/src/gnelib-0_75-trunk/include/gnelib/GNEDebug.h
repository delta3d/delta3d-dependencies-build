 *        gneHH'MM'SS.log
 * @param levelMask sets just how detailed the trace is, and will display

 *              go, the more detailed the trace should get.  This is so to

 *              3 - average level.  packet registration, socket registration\n
 *              4 - events like onReceive and such, and some reporting.\n
 *              5 - very low level -- thread creation, memory allocation.
 * @param fn The file name this trace was called from
 * @param lineno The line number in the file
 * @param msg The message to display to the logfile, in printf style,
 *            followed by the data.
