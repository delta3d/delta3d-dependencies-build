 * @defgroup internal Internal Classes
 *
 * These items are used only internally by the library in the normal cases.
 * This documentation is provided for those curious about some of the inner
 * workings of the library, or who want to extend on the functionality of
 * the library internals.
 *
 * The typical user should not need to pay attention to any of these items.

/**
 * @defgroup midlevel Mid-Level API
 *
 * This is the original API, which is completed.  The mid-level API works
 * with connections and packets.  It provides the basics of communications
 * between two computers.  The high-level API expands from these classes to
 * provide high-level functionality.

/**
 * @defgroup highlevel High-Level API
 *
 * This API is still very much in progress.  Unlike the mid-level API, the
 * high-level API deals with servers, players, and objects.

/**
 * @defgroup threading Threading API
 *
 * This low-level API provides a framework for creating multi-threaded
 * applications.

/**
 * @defgroup console Console API
 *
 * This low-level API provides multithreaded console access in multiple
 * environments.  It should be robust enough to support text-based interfaces
 * for server programs, to make them more friendly to be run remotely from
 * UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
 *
 * The API is also used as an I/O system for the GNE examples
