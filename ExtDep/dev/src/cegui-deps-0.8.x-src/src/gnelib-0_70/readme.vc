MSVC-specific information for GNE.

The main platform support for GNE is MSVC, so this port should be the least
quirky.  The MSVC workspace file in the root directory of the project should
contain everything needed to compile the library and the examples.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

You can view detailed installation instructions at
http://www.rit.edu/~jpw9607/gne/tutorials/msvcinstall.htm

NOTE: GNE only works under MSVC.NET or later.  MSVC6 will not work.

If you cannot view the tutorial, here is a short set of instructions for the
knowledgable:

Install HawkNL, preferably with NL_WIN_THREADS defined.  You need to make sure
that HawkNL is visible in your compiler's include paths by adding the HawkNL
directory.

The same applies for Boost, although Boost does not need to be compiled first.

Then load the gne.sln namespace and compile.  It will generate gne.lib or
gned.lib depending on release or debug mode.
