  GNE is released under the terms of the LGPL.  It is a library for providing
networking for games.  The file "License" contains the full text of the LGPL.

To learn more about what GNE will do visit:

The documentation for GNE is generated by a program called doxygen, which
generates HTML from specially designed comments in the source code.  This
documentation also includes a beginner's guide. The documentation can also be
viewed online at the GNE website if you do not wish to install doxygen.

The other readme files in this directory contain specific instructions for
your compiler.

Missing Features

* Thread priorities have not been implemented in UNIX because I haven't been
  able to figure how how to do this portably with pthreads yet -- if you know
  how, feel free to speak up ;).  They do work in Windows, however.

* Throwing exceptions in the readPacket and maybe the writePacket methods
  will be allowed and caught to signal the caller that parsing of the packet
  cannot be completed.  Not having this functionality is not very bad right
  now as TCP and UDP protocols guarantee that data inside of packets is
  always sent correctly if it arrives, therefore readPacket should only fail
  due to a programming error.  For now it is advised that you use asserts to
  check for this problem.
