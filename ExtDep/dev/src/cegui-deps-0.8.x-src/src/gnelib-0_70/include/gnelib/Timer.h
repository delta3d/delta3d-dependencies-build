 * A timer object calls its listeners back every so often based on the time
 * given.
 *
 * All of the methods in this class are safe to call from multiple threads at
 * the same time, and can also be called from the TimerCallback as well, with
 * a few (some obvious) exceptions.
 *
 * A Timer thread runs with a higher priority than the main thread, therefore
 * its callbacks are suitable for short, quick tasks.
