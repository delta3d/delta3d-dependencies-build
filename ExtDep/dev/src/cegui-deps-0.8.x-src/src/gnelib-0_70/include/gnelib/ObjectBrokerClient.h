   *
   * If the passed packet is an ObjectCreationPacket, a new object is created
   * with the registered create function and returned.  If an object with the
   * ID already exists, then an Error is thrown with code
   * Error::DuplicateObjectID.  If the packet type used to create the object
   * has not been registered, then an Error with the ID
   * Error::InvalidCreationPacketType is thrown.
   *
   * If the passed packet is an ObjectUpdatePacket, the specified object is
   * given the packet to update itself with, and that object is returned.  If
   * no objects with the ID in the packet exist, an Error is thrown with code
   * Error::UnknownObjectId.  If ignoreUpdateError is set to true, then NULL
   * instead is returned, and no action is taken on the packet.  This
   * particular flag is useful, because if updates are sent unreliably, then
   * it is possible for an update for an object to arrive BEFORE its creation
   * packet.
   *
   * If the passed packet is an ObjectDeathPacket, the specified object's
   * incomingDeathPacket and onDeregistration events are called, and that
   * object is returned.  If no objects with the ID in the packet exist, an
   * Error is thrown with code Error::UnknownObjectId.
   *
   * If the passed packet is not any one of these types, then an Error with
   * code Error::InvalidObjectPacket is thrown.
   *
   * In all cases, either a valid NetworkObject is returned, or an Error is
   * thrown.  The single exception is that NULL can be returned if
   * ignoreUpdateError is passed as true, and ObjectUpdatePacket processing
   * failed because of an unknown packet ID, which should be the only typical
   * error case.
