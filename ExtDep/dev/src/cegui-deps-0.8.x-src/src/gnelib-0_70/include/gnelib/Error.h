 * a textual description of the error.  Objects of type Error are not thread
 * safe.  This is usually OK since Error objects are not typically shared by
 * threads.
 *
 * If you want to define your own classes from Error, feel free to do so.
 * This may be useful if you want to throw Errors during readPacket or
 * writePacket.  If you inherit from Error, unless one of the current error
 * codes apply, you should give the Error a code of User and overload the
 * toString method to provide your own error description.
