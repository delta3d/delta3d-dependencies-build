/**
 * @ingroup midlevel
 *
 * Using the PingPacket is one way to measure ping and clock offsets from a
 * remote machine.  Measuring ping and clock offset are very similar operations
 * in how they work, and because the extra overhead of measuring clock offset
 * is small, that functionality was added into PingPacket.  The effectiveness
 * of the clock synchronization is discussed in the GNE Protocol specification,
 * available on the GNE web site. Ping capability was not integrated into the
 * Connection class to give you the largest flexibility on how to measure
 * latency and ping in your games.
 *
 * A choice had to be made between synchronizing actual real clock times, or
 * synchronizing on an arbitrary server clock. Due to the fact that absolute
 * time clocks have less resolution in some platforms (ie Windows), and
 * because of possible difficulties surrounding differing timezones and
 * GMT-UTC differences, the clock synchronization will be based on an
 * arbitrary clock on the server. This allows the server to use the clock with
 * the highest resolution, and perhaps more importantly, the server can use
 * the same clock for synchronizing and for timing the game logic. The
 * important part to know from this is that the clock offsets may be extreme
 * (as GMT is used in Linux, and seconds since CPU powerup in Windows), and
 * thus may not fit into a 32-bit integer with microsecond accuracy.
 *
 * Since the PingPackets will be placed into the queue and received as
 * normal, this will be measuring effective ping rather than the actual time
 * it takes for the packet to travel there and back, giving a more realistic
 * view of lag.
 *
 * The way to use PingPackets:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Create a new PingPacket.  The constructor will make a ping request
 *       with the proper unique request ID.</li>
 *   <li>Send the packet to whoever you want, any way you want.</li>
 *   <li>When reading the incoming packet stream, check for PingPackets.<br>
 *       Discover if they are requests or replies by calling isRequest.<br>
 *       If they are requests, call makeReply and send it back.<br>
 *       If they are replies, call getPing to measure the round trip time.</li>
 *   <li>If you send packets over an unreliable connection, call
 *       recoverLostRequests to declare late packets as "lost" and recover any
 *       used memory in the request table.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Check out the exping example for an example and more explaination on how
 * to use PingPacket.
