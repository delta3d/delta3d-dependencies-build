/**
 * @ingroup midlevel
 *
 * This is an abstract base class representing an interface to the Connection,
 * ClientConnection, and ServerConnection classes.  All of the events that
 * those three classes generate are in this class, and classes listening to
 * the events on these classes will inherit from this class.
 *
 * Override the events you want to receive with this listener.  The provided
 * functions do nothing, so that event overloading is optional in all cases.
 *
 * onConnect and onConnectFailure are generated only by ClientConnection and
 * onNewConn is generated only by ServerConnection.
 *
 * Note that there is only one event thread per Connection, so one one event
 * will be active at a time.  Take this into consideration that you may be
 * able to eliminated some syncronization and mutexes that would otherwise be
 * needed.  onNewConn or onConnect or onConnectFailure are guaranteed to be
 * the first events from a connection, and won't be called multiple times.
 * onDisconnect will always be the last called (except after
 * onConnectFailure, where there never was a connection) and will only be
 * called once.  Since only one event can be active at a time, you will want
 * to return quickly so other events can be processed, but note that if you
 * have a PacketFeeder set up for a connection, those events are independent
 * of ConnectionListener's events, so both types of events can be occuring
 * at the same time.
