Linux(Unix) specific information for GNE.

If you have an old GCC 2.95 system, note that you will need to add OLD_CPP=1
to your make line.

Detailed instructions are provided in the GNE tutorials.  You can view them
online at http://www.rit.edu/~jpw9607/gne/tutorials/linuxinstall.htm.

1. ncurses

GNE uses the ncurses library.  GNE was created with the libncurses5.2 library,
others may or may not work.  In all of the distributions I've used,
libncurses-devel comes with it which installs everything you need.

2. Installation

Install HawkNL.  HawkNL has its own installation process, which does involve
a makefile.

Install Boost.  GNE does not make use of any of the compiled parts of Boost,
so no compilation is needed.

If you did not install HawkNL and Boost into your compiler's default search
paths, you need to give paths to the files in the LibPaths.mak file.

In a shell, execute:

fixlinux.sh

Which should give you a short description of the makefile options. Now type:

make

To compile the library and examples. Then type:

make install

To install GNE into the following default locations:

/usr/local/lib/libgnelib.a
/usr/local/include/gnelib.h

Should you ever wish to uninstall these two installed files from your system
(and it might be a good idea before upgrading to a newer version as well),
use:

make uninstall

3. Documentation

After installing, you may want to generate the documentation using doxygen.
Doxygen can be found in many distributions, or at the Doxygen website (see
the Readme file).

You can also download the documentation, beginner's guide, and GNE tutorials
from the GNE website.

If you wish to generate the documentation, use the following command:

doxygen doxygen.cfg
