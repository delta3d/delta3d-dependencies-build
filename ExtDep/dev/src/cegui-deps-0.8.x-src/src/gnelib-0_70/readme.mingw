MingW specific information for GNE.

If you have an old GCC 2.95 system, note that you will need to add OLD_CPP=1
to your make line.

Detailed instructions are provided in the GNE tutorials.  You can view them
online at http://www.rit.edu/~jpw9607/gne/tutorials/mingwinstall.htm.

Installation:

Install HawkNL.  HawkNL has its own installation process, which does involve
a makefile.

Install Boost.  GNE does not make use of any of the compiled parts of Boost,
so no compilation is needed.

If you did not install HawkNL and Boost into your compiler's default search
paths, you need to give paths to the files in the LibPaths.mak file.

Inside a command prompt, type:

fixming

Which should give you a short description of the makefile options. Now type:

make

To compile the library and examples. Now type:

make install

To install GNE. Should you ever wish to uninstall all the files installed by
this from your system (and it might be a good idea before upgrading to a newer
version as well), use:

make uninstall

NOTE: MINGDIR must be set for make install to work.  It will install the files
into MINGDIR/include and MINGDIR/lib.

Example:
SET MINGDIR=C:\mingw
make install
