This directory holds source code for a standalone application that converts a
rigged model from DirectX (.X) format to Cal3D (.csf, .cmf, ...) format.  It was
contributed to the Cal3D project by its author, Kenneth Schafer of Innoventive
Software LLC, <http://www.frameforge3d.com/>.

The project currently requires Delphi 5 or later.  However, in theory it 
should be possible to make the code work with FreePascal
<http://www.freepascal.org/> and Lazarus
<http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php>, thus becoming more 
cross-platform.
