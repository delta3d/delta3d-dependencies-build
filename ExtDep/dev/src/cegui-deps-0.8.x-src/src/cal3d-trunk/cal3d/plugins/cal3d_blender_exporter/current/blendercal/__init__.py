NOTE:

This code (well, just the bcobject code, though it it also highly modified),
is based loosely on the original code by Jiba in blender2cal3d.py. Many thanks
to him for his initial work on paving the way! Other than that, most of this
code is entirely original by Jeremy Moles and Palle Raabjerg, with a bit of
influence from Loic Dachary, especially in the bcdata.AnimationData().
