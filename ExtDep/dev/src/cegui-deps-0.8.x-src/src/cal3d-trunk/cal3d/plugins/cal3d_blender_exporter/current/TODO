- Investigate spring support.

- Investigate LOD support.
  
  Palle is working on this now. 7/20/06

- Investigate why some of my models get <!-- UV Coords Unset -->.
  
  Solved. Test explicitly for None instead of 0.0.

- Create a "super-layout" option where files are put into directories
  based on their type.

- Can we create textures "on the fly" using the materials Blender uses
  internally? If so, this would be the freaking HOTNESS.

  Note: I assume we mean the blender generated textures (cloud, etc.).
  Have it on good authority that there is no standard, or easy
  way to do this directly from the Blender API.
  But it may be possible by integrating functionality from the tex2uvbaker.py
  script (included with Blender). The functionality is very similar.

- Implement the VIEW and @exception stuff, so that a dialog is popped
  up with an exception and VIEW shows the bones, meshes, etc, the exporter
  is aware of.

- Create hooks for using Blender Shapes as Morph Targets in Cal3D.

- Add an optional call out to cal3d_converter for binary exportation.

- Implement a UI to allowing choosing of animations.
